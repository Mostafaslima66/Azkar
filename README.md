# Azkarapp

Azkarapp is a mobile application developed using Flutter and Dart. This app is designed to assist users in performing various Islamic rituals, such as Tasbeeh, and provides a collection of different Azkar (supplications). The app offers several features, including customizable reminders for Azkar and a digital Sebha with a counter, all while storing data locally on the user's device.

## Features

- **Local Notifications**: Azkarapp can send local notifications to remind users of different Azkar at specified times. Users can set these reminder times themselves, allowing for a personalized experience.
- **Variety of Azkar**: The app includes a wide range of Azkar, such as:
  - Morning Azkar
  - Evening Azkar
  - Food Azkar
  - Travel Azkar
  - Afterpray Azkar
  - Exit Azkar

  Users can choose any of these Azkar and set different reminder times, which are stored locally on their device.
  
- **Digital Sebha**: The app features a digital Sebha, allowing users to perform Tasbeeh. Users can select any prayer they wish to count, and the counter will keep track of their progress, with the data stored locally on their device.

- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a smooth user experience across different devices.
